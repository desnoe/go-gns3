# go-gns3

*go-gns3* is a Go library that can be used to interact with a [GNS3 server](https://github.com/GNS3/gns3-server) using its HTTP REST API. A GNS3 server manages emulators such as Dynamips, VirtualBox or Qemu/KVM.

## Disclaimer

This library does not aim at explaining nor documenting in any way the GNS3 server API. Please check the [GNS3 server official documentation](https://gns3-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for further information.
